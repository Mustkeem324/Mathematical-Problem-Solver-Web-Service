# README

This README provides documentation for the PHP script provided in the repository.

## Description

The provided PHP script serves as a web service designed to process images containing mathematical text. It extracts the mathematical text from the image, uploads it to a server for further processing, generates step-by-step solutions to the mathematical problem, and then reveals the answers in HTML format.

## Usage

1. **Input**: 
   - Send a HTTP GET request to the script's endpoint with a query parameter `url` containing the URL of the image file.

2. **Output**:
   - The script will return an HTML page displaying the original mathematical text and the step-by-step solutions.

## Requirements

- PHP server environment with cURL extension enabled.
- Access to external API endpoints mentioned in the script.
- MathJax library for rendering mathematical expressions in HTML.

## Setup

1. Ensure PHP is installed and properly configured on your server.
2. Verify that the cURL extension is enabled in your PHP configuration.
3. Include the MathJax library in your project for rendering mathematical expressions.
4. Customize the script to fit your specific requirements, adjusting API endpoints or headers if needed.
5. Deploy the script to your server.

## Security Considerations

- Validate input URLs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
- Utilize HTTPS when communicating with external APIs to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- Implement robust error handling to prevent information leakage.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided as-is without any warranties or guarantees. Use it at your own risk and ensure compliance with the terms of service of any external APIs used.
